##  Abraxas Online

Abraxas is an MMORPG. This repo has a VB6 (yes, Visual Basic VI) version based on Argentum Online, an argentinian free (as in Freedom) MMORPG.


###  Requirements:
 - Window OS with DirectX 7
 - Visual Basic 6 
 - MySQL Server (dont't tested with MariaDB). You can use AppServ 2.5.10.
 - MySQL ODBC 3.51 (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/3.51.html)

You need to create a database a dump the dump.sql file content on it.

You may want to set the server's listening port on Servidor.ini and set it with the host IP (or domain) on the client. It's currently configured with localhost at port 7666.
