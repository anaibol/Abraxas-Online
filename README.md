#  Abraxas Online!

Abraxas is an MMORPG. This repo has a VB6 (yes, Visual Basic VI) version based on Argentum Online, an argentinian free (from freedom) MMORPG.

##  Requirements:
 - Window^ OS
 - Visual Basic 6 (to develop, debug and compile)
 - MySQL Server (dont't tested with MariaDB). You can use AppServ 2.5.10.
 - MySQL ODBC 3.51 (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/3.51.html)

Run ```npm install``` (joke)

You may set the server's listening port on Servidor.ini and set it with the host IP (or domain) on the client. It's currently configured with localhost at port 7666.
